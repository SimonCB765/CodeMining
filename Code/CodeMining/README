To run the model training simply run the main.m script.
There are no command line flags, but there are variables within the script that can be changed to alter the running of the script.

The basic flow of the script is to process the patient dataset, train and initial model (elastic net), determine which examples
	in the dataset should be discarded and then train a second model (elastic net) on the non-discarded examples.
The script creates a directory to hold all the results. These include:
	Statistics about the dataset and model training.
	Performance of the models.
	Codes identified by both models as being discriminatory, along with the coefficients for the codes.
	Disambiguation of medical records containing both type 1 and type 2 diabetes codes (if that analysis is chosen).

PatientData.tsv
	Data on the patients. There is no header, and each row has three columns. The first contains a unique ID for the patient,
		the second has a clinical code and the third has a count of the number of times the code has appeared in the patient's medical record.
	Each patient ID can (and does) appear on multiple rows.
	Each clinical code can appear connected to multiple patients.
	Together the rows for a given patient ID make up their medical history.
CutDownPatientData.tsv
	A random much smaller subset of the rows in PatientData.tsv used to test the scripts.
coding.mat and coding.tsv
	These files contain the mapping between clinical codes and their descriptions. The content is the same, just the formatting is different.
	coding.tsv has no header and one row per code. Each row is formatted as Code\tDescription.
	coding.mat is a Matlab object that can be loaded directly into Matlab.
