Any result files beginning with ExternalFold_ were generated by the external fold performance testing.

Ambiguous.tsv - predictions for both models on the ambiguous examples.
BestParameters.tsv - the optimal parameters found.
BothModelDescentResults.tsv - the record of the SGD descent for each model.
BothModelPredictions.tsv - the predictions of both models on their training examples. Dashes are used for the second model on discarded examples.
Coefficients.tsv - the coefficients for both models.
HoldOutPerformance.tsv - the results of exploring parameter space using half dataset holdout testing.
ParameterOptimisation.tsv - the results of optimising the parameters using cross validation.
